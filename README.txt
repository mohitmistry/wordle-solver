Please run Wordle_solver.py through the terminal. 

The code is currently in Version 1 - whereas, it can help you solve Wordle using a text file with all 5 letter words found in the list of 500k english words (dict.txt).

You must manually input your first guess into both wordle and this input, then match the colour key as another input. 

The program will then filter and print ~10 words for you to try in the next guess. This occurs iteratively until the word is guessed or you hit 6 guesses. 


TO SCALE: 
Wordle has a dictionaly of just over 2k words, to make this future proof while also giving you guesses wordle might have, future updates will include a frequency ranking (how much do we use the word IRL) and a letter ranking (does this next word have high frequency letters that we can guess to narrow the search much more). This way, we get contextual guesses when the program gives you a list of words to try.
